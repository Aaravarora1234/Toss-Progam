This is a simple program that uses the random module to generate a random outcome and compares it with the user's choice. This comparison is to decide if the user won. If the 
User's choice matches with the random outcome it is likely to be the Desired outcome and hence the User wins the toss. I have coded the entire program inside a while loop,
specifically an infinite loop, enabling an in-built restart or endgame functionality, so that the user can play it once more without re-running the code. The program
is coded entirely in the Visual Studio Code IDE and runs in the console when the User plays it. I hope you liked my code and if so please keep supporting me to begin my 
journey towards becoming a software engineer
